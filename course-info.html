            <b><font color="#623c9b">Overview:</font></b> This course allows students the opportunity to design and implement a software project from start to finish.  Projects started in COMP495 must be completed in this course for students working on a yearlong project.  Students choosing to do a semester project must start and complete the project in this course.  This course gives the student the opportunity to work on a software project of significant size.

            <b><font color="#623c9b">Use of Email: </font></b> You cannot expect to get last-minute help on assignments by email. Although it's easy for you to dash off an email question, it takes time to answer it. In general, you should not ask email questions to which you can find the answer somewhere else (e.g., class notes, web page). If you must send an email, spend extra time to ensure that you are both brief and clear. Please include your name in the "From:" line of the email message, not just your email address. Email is a valuable tool for communicating with the instructional team. But be sure to use it properly, and follow the rules of good email etiquette (e.g., no flaming, spamming, etc.). Email messages will be sent to the student's A&T email address. It is the student's responsibility to regularly check their A&T email account.

            <b><font color="#623c9b">Grade Disputes: </font></b> If you are dissatisfied with a grade you receive, you must submit your complaint briefly in writing or by email, along with supporting evidence or arguments, within one week of the date that we first attempted to return the exam or assignment to you. 
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The grade you are given on an exam, a quiz, an assignment, or as your final grade, is not the starting point of a negotiation. It is your grade unless a concrete error has been made. Do not come to the instructors or TAs to ask for a better grade because you want one or you feel you deserve it. Come only if you can document a specific error in grading or in recording your scores.  Errors can certainly be made in grading, especially when many students are involved.  But keep in mind that errors can be made either in your favor or not. So it is possible that if you ask to have a piece of work re-graded your grade will go down rather than up.
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember that the most important characteristic of any grading scheme is that it be fair. Keep this in mind if you're thinking of asking, for example, for more partial credit points on a problem. The important thing is not the exact number of points that were taken off for each kind of mistake. The important thing is that that number was the same for everyone.
